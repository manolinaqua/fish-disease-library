## Overview

### What is Tenacibaculosis?
Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial ulcerative disease caused by multiple species within the genus _Tenacibaculum_, affecting numerous fish species in aquaculture [Habib, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4136090/). It is characterised by ulcerative and/or necrotic skin lesions, an eroded/hemorrhagic mouth, frayed fins, and tail rot; often leading to high mortality and significant economic losses [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). The disease was first identified in Japan in the 1970s and has since been reported in many marine wild and farmed fish in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia [Mabrok, 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/). Despite extensive research, there is still no complete treatment   [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)[Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full)

## Symptoms of Tenacibaculosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Ulcers:** Deep, necrotic ulcers on the skin, often around the mouth, fins, and body.
    - **Fin Erosion:** Fraying and degradation of the fins, especially the caudal (tail) fin.
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin and fins due to bleeding.
    - **Exophthalmia:** Bulging or protruding eyes.
    - **Necrosis:** Tissue death in severe cases, leading to extensive damage.

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming.
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss.
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim erratically or show signs of distress due to pain from ulcers.


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Small, localized lesions and mild redness around the mouth and fins.
- **Advanced Stages:** Severe skin ulcers, extensive fin erosion, and high mortality if left untreated.
- **Impact on Fish Health:** Tenacibaculosis severely compromises the skin barrier, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).

### Causes of Tenacibaculosis

**Etiology**
The genus Tenacibaculum currently contains a total of 39 valid fish-pathogenic and environmental species [taxa](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/tenacibaculum). *Tenacibaculum* spp are generally considered opportunistic pathogens, i.e doesn't normally cause disease, but can cause infection when the opportunity arises [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)

_Tenacibaculum maritimum_ also known as "yellow mouth disease" (in British Columbia, Canada and Washington State), “gliding bacterial diseases of sea fish”, "marine flexibacteriosis", “eroded mouth syndrome” and “black patch necrosis” is one of the better known species in the genus.
- **Causative Agents:** Causative species of tenacibaculosis in fish, include; *Tenacibaculum maritimum, Tenacibaculum soleae, Tenacibaculum discolor, Tenacibaculum gallaicum, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi* and *Tenacibaculum finnmarkense* [Fernandez, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291367/). 

- **Transmission Methods:**
    - **Direct Contact:** 
	    - T. maritimum can be horizontally transferred between fish [FHF](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)
    - **Waterborne:**
	    -  _T. finnmarkense_: Different strains vary in their ability to cause disease, and the bacterium is not readily transmitted between fish [Småge, 2018]
	    - The bacterium can spread through water, especially under conditions of poor water quality and high organic load [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).


**Risk Factors**

- **Environmental Factors:** Salinity, water temperature, seasonality, algal or jellyfish blooms can affect susceptibility to Tenacibaculosis [Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full), [Småge, 2018]

- **Farm Management Practices:** High rearing density, reduced or excessive feed administration, fresh to saltwater transfer of smolts (salmonids) and/or mechanical damage of the skin and mucus barrier [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/), [Van Gelderen, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21387991/), [Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full)


### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**
Diagnosis of tenacibaculosis is usually based on culture-dependent detection and identification techniques which are time-consuming and do not allow to differentiate closely related species [Fernandez, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291367/)

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin ulcers and fin erosion.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of _Tenacibaculum maritimum_ from tissue samples.
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects bacterial DNA in tissue samples.
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the extent of tissue damage and infection [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)


**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Tenacibaculosis from Other Diseases:** *Tenacibaculum* spp can often be in the wounds with other bacterium such as [[Moritella Viscosa]] [NIV2] 

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**

- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** The most used measure to control *T.maritimum* [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) Administered through medicated feed or water to treat bacterial infections. The bacteria are naturally resistant to quinolones (a type of antibiotics commonly used against gram-negative bacteria), so efficacy is limited  [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose)


- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Improving Water Quality:** Ensuring optimal water conditions to support healing and reduce stress.
    - **Reducing Stocking Densities:** Lowering fish density to minimize the spread of infection [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Implementing strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction and spread of _Tenacibaculum maritimum_.
    - Regular monitoring of fish health to detect and address early signs of infection.
- **Vaccines**:
	- No available vaccine

- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Using equipment and facilities designed to minimize skin abrasions and injuries.
    - Ensuring adequate nutrition to support immune function and wound healing.
    - Implementing fallowing periods and site rotations to break the infection cycle [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)
    -  salmon that have been exposed to low-strength salinity appear to have a better ability to respond to an infection. [FHF](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)

### Case Studies

**Real-World Examples**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    - **Japan (1970s):** The first identified outbreaks led to significant losses and increased awareness of Tenacibaculosis.
    - **Norway (2010s):** Major outbreaks started gaining attention, although the bacteria had been present since at least the 1980s. [10](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259215).
    - **Chile (2010s):** Severe outbreaks caused substantial economic impact and prompted industry reforms [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/) [2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf) 

- **Lessons Learned:** The importance of early detection, robust biosecurity, and coordinated response efforts in controlling Tenacibaculosis outbreaks [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).
