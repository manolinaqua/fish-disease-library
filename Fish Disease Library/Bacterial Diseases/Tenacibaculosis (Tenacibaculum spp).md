## Overview

### What is Tenacibaculosis?
Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial ulcerative disease caused by multiple species within the genus _Tenacibaculum_, affecting numerous fish species in aquaculture [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4136090/). It is characterised by ulcerative and/or necrotic skin lesions, an eroded/hemorrhagic mouth, frayed fins, and tail rot; often leading to high mortality and significant economic losses [2](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). The disease was first identified in Japan in the 1970s and has since been reported in many marine wild and farmed fish in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/). Despite extensive research, there is still no complete treatment   [2](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)[5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full)

## Symptoms of Tenacibaculosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Ulcers:** Deep, necrotic ulcers on the skin often surrounded by a darkened area or zone of yellow. Ulcers often found around the mouth, fins, and body (for pictures see [Sandoval](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2369) )
    - **Fin Erosion:** Fraying and degradation of the fins, especially the caudal (tail) fin.
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin and fins due to bleeding.
    - **Gill lesions:** erosion and necrosis with little inflammation, filamentous bacteria mats also found covering the gills and necrotic tissue [6](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)
    - **Systemic infections** can result in some cases, depending on the isolate involved [6](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)
    - In cases of *Tenacibaculum maritimum* yellow mats form on the inside of the mouth especially in Atlantic salmon [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6211739/) in some cases teeth can fall out  [6](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming.
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [8](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/) 
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim erratically or show signs of distress due to pain from ulcers.


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Small, localized lesions and mild redness around the mouth and fins.
- **Advanced Stages:** Severe skin ulcers, extensive fin erosion, and high mortality if left untreated.
- **Impact on Fish Health:** Tenacibaculosis severely compromises the skin barrier, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[9](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).

### Causes of Tenacibaculosis

**Etiology**
The genus Tenacibaculum currently contains a total of 39 valid fish-pathogenic and environmental species [10](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/tenacibaculum). *Tenacibaculum* spp are generally considered opportunistic pathogens, i.e don't normally cause disease, but can cause infection when the opportunity arises [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). Pathogenic species include: *T. maritimum, Tenacibaculum soleae, Tenacibaculum discolor, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi* and *Tenacibaculum finnmarkense*, *Tenacibaculum* _ovolyticum_ [11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291367/). It was previously named flexibacteriosis. 


- **Causative Agents:** 
	- *T. maritimum_* is one of the better researched species in the genus. It is also known as "yellow mouth disease" (in British Columbia, Canada and Washington State), “gliding bacterial diseases of sea fish”, "marine flexibacteriosis", “eroded mouth syndrome” and “black patch necrosis”. Originally described in 1970s with mortalities among farmed red (_Pagrus major_) and blackhead (_Acanthopagrus schlegelii_) seabream in Japan [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). It has strong adhesion to fish skin and mucus, needs seawater (≥10%), optimal growth 25-30°C, gram negative  and is thin and rod-shaped [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- *T.*soleae* identified from Senegalese sole (_Solea senegalensis_) and turbot _Scophthalmus maximus_. Mainly sole specific and causes similar ulcers as other Tenacibaculum species  [12](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.65397-0)
	- *T. discolor* identified from European and Asian sea bass (_Dicentrarchus labrax_ and _Lates calcarifer_) [12](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.65397-0). Less pathogenic/emerging compared to the main species and mainly environmental or opportunistic [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- *T. dicentrarchi* identified from Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21460137/). Suggested to be more pathogenic to non-salmonid species [14]
	- *T. finnmarkense* identified from  rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) and Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26662517/) [16](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/11/1439). Is it quite virulent (causes more damage to host, disease at lower doses or spreads/grows faster), but higher doses of the virus are needed to infect at 8 °C than at 4 °C  [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/). Spilt into 2 genetic sub-groups (called genomovars, gv): *gv. finnmarkense and gv. ulcerans* [18](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901434/)
	- *T. ovolyticum* identified in Atlantic halibut (_Hippoglossus hippoglossus_) and farmed Atlantic Salmon (_Salmo salar_) [19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35652633/). Grows in cold seawater and associated with deep/cold water environments [20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4929521/). Mainly an egg pathogen historically, but emerging as a cause of tenacibaculosis in farmed fish [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).

- **Transmission Methods:**


    - **Direct Contact:** 
	    - *T. maritimum*, _T. dicentrarchi_ can be horizontally transferred between fish [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/), [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 

    - **Waterborne:**
	    -  _T. finnmarkense_: Different strains vary in their ability to cause disease, and the bacterium is not readily transmitted between fish [14]

| New Zealand _Tenacibaculum_ spp. (includes _T. maritimum_ types and _T. dicentrarchi_) | Only caused disease in experiments when fish were exposed by immersion, showing that spread happens mainly through water onto skin and gills.                                                 | [22](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.06.583827v1)​ |
**Risk Factors**
Disease from _T. maritimum_ peaks in a 15–26°C range but varies by location/fish species; stress  and bad conditions which make outbreaks worse [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/).
- **Environmental Factors:** Salinity, water temperature, seasonality, algal or jellyfish blooms can affect susceptibility to Tenacibaculosis [5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). 
	- Some regions: more cases with warming waters (Tasmania); others: winter outbreaks (15–20°C ideal in Spain). [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- For _T. finnmarkense_ colder water temperatures >8°C increase the risk

- **Farm Management Practices:** Generally high rearing density, excessive feed administration (especially in the case of *T.maritimum* which focuses in the mouth [6](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)) , fresh to saltwater transfer of smolts (salmonids) and/or mechanical damage of the skin and mucus barrier, healthy fish carrying the disease [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/), [23](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21387991/), [5](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full),  [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/), Some specific risks for other species:
	- For _T. finnmarkense_ transferring salmonid smolt from high salinity environments to low sea temps in the sea increases tenacibaculosis infection [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/).
	- For *T. dicentrarchi* skin or gill damage increase disease susceptabilty, potentially warmer temperatures [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 
	- For *T. ovolyticum* risks include bad hygiene or presence of disease on eggs, cold deep sea water, possible equipment contamination [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 
	- For *T. soleae* risks include being in Sole/brill aquaculture (Spain), tank systems, high mortality in juveniles


### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**
Diagnostic methods for Tenacibaculum infections primarily involve culture isolation, microscopy, molecular techniques like PCR and MLSA, and proteomics such as MALDI-TOF MS [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/)

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin ulcers and fin erosion.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of *Tenacibaculum spp* from tissue samples on selective agar plates with MALDI-TOF MS or biochemical tests identify species [21](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/)
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects bacterial DNA in tissue samples. PCR assays have been developed for _T. dicentrarchi_, _T. maritimum_ and _T. soleae_ [24](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v136/dao03407) Norway favors MLSA for strain diversity; qPCR is routine in EU labs for surveillance [25](https://ressources.ciheam.org/ressources/om/pdf/b75/00007944.pdf), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/) 
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the extent of tissue damage and infection, but not for species ID [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[9](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)


**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Tenacibaculosis from Other Diseases:** *Tenacibaculum* spp can often be in the wounds with other bacterium such as [[Moritella Viscosa]] [26] and Aliivibrio, but they lack the thin gliding rods of *Tenacibaculum* spp [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).
- Infections are often with multiple strains or even Tenacibaculum species, which also results in poor treatment efficacy  [8](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/) [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**
A summary table for each species is found below.
- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Most common measure to control *T.maritimum* with varying degrees of success [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) Administered through medicated feed or water to treat bacterial infections. The bacteria are naturally resistant to quinolones (a type of antibiotics commonly used against gram-negative bacteria), so efficacy is limited  [2](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose)


- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Improving Water Quality:** Ensuring optimal water conditions to support healing and reduce stress [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427474/)
    - **Reducing Stocking Densities:** Reduce stocking density during the whole life cycle to keep stress levels down (low stress = good immunity) and minimise skin damage [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427474/)
    - **Nutritional support:** Especially during first feeding, use high quality diets, and functional ingredients (e.g., immunostimulants, certain algae, probiotics or prebiotics) that may enhance skin and gut barriers and reduce lesion severity [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427474/). Essential oils have also shown to reduce mortalities in sea bream [28](https://www.academia.edu/2837-4010/3/3/10.20935/AcadBiol7847).

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Regular monitoring of fish health to detect and address (ether by antibiotics or culling) early signs of infection [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
    - Different strains of _T. maritimum_ are locally sourced and not internationally, which helps with genetic tracking of outbreaks  [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4136090/).

    
- **Vaccines**:
	- No commercial vaccine, except for one for turbot in Spain, which needs boosters [31](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15962472/) . The broad genetic variety means broad vaccines fail [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
	- Tested vaccines include: barramundi in Singapore, salmon in Tasmania, salmon in Chile [8](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/), whole cell inactivated adjuvanted vaccine against _T. finnmarkense_  [14] and immunization with recombinant proteins against _T. finnmarkense_ [30](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901655/)


- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Using equipment and facilities designed to minimize skin abrasions and injuries.
    - Ensuring adequate nutrition to support immune function and wound healing.
    - Implementing fallowing periods and site rotations to break the infection cycle [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[9](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)
    - Salmonids that have been exposed to low-strength salinity appear to have a better ability to respond to an infection. [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)
    - Salmonid transfer to sea above  5˚C significantly lowers _T. finnmarkense_ infection rates [18](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901434/)

### Case Studies

**Real-World Examples**

- **Notable Outbreaks:**
    - **Japan (1970s):** The first identified outbreaks led to significant losses and increased awareness of Tenacibaculosis.
    
    - **Norway (2010s):** Major outbreaks started gaining attention, although the bacteria had been present since at least the 1980s. [4](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259215). 
	    - In Finnmark (northern Norway) in 2015 mortalities were up to 40% in recently transferred smolt [14]
    
    - **Chile (2010s):** Severe outbreaks caused substantial economic impact and prompted industry reforms [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/) [9](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf). 
	    - **2018–2019**: First major reports post-seawater transfer *T. dicentrarchi* dominant, mortality up to 10% by mid-2019 (rising from 0% in company stats) [32](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32662133/)
	    - **2020 new hosts**: Clinical cases confirmed in rainbow trout and coho salmon farms (first globally for coho) *T. dicentrarchi* and *T. finnmarkense* isolated in Los Lagos [32](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32662133/)
      
    - **Europe (1990s):** First European cases in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cages, spreading from Japan [33](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1254677/full). **2009–2010 Spain**: Three outbreaks in wedge sole at 20.5°C; *T. maritimum* isolated from ulcers [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
    
    - **Italy/Greece/Turkey (2000s–2010s)**: Sea bass farms affected, raising aquaculture concerns [33](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1254677/full).​

## Data Insights
### Disease Impact by Country

#### Canada

- **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in Canada:**
    - Tenacibaculosis, particuarly *T. maritimum* is a significant concern in Canada, particularly in British Columbia, where it affects both wild and farmed salmon populations  [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf), [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon). Recurrent. *T. finnmarkense* and *T. dicentrarchi* also contribute to outbreaks, particularly in juveniles post-transfer to net-pens [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf)
    - Diagnosed annually since 2003 across BC salmon farms, with 106 farm-level cases from 2002-2018 audits [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf)

- **Geographical Spread:**
    - The disease is prevalent in marine net pen Atlantic salmon farms in British Columbia, with outbreaks also reported in other regions and in the wild [35](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.17.529034v1.full).

- **Economic Impact:**
    - The annual cost associated with Tenacibaculosis outbreaks in British Columbia is estimated to be $1.8 million, with an additional revenue loss of $3.8 million per year [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon).
    - A single outbreak can cost up to $500,000 CAD [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf)

- **Treatment & Management:**
    - Management practices include the use of antibiotics during outbreaks, though there are concerns about resistance [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf) 
    - Recent research efforts focus on developing vaccines to prevent the disease [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon), [Onda](https://aquatechcenter.com/disease_challenge/mouth-rot/)
     - In-feed immune boosting agents have been suggested to help [34](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40952824.pdf)

#### Chile

- **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in Chile:**
    - Severe outbreaks and reoccurence of Tenacibaculosis have been reported in Chile, causing substantial economic impact and prompting industry reforms [14](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/19440).
    - Primarily caused by *T. dicentrarchi* (most cases), with *T. maritimum* and *T. finnmarkense* less common, it ranked as the second leading cause of Atlantic salmon mortality in early 2023 (32.9% of deaths) [36](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.006963) 
    - Outbreaks peak after seawater transfer (smoltification stress) and at >1 kg body weight, worsened by handling, low oxygen, algal blooms, or co-infections. Previously misdiagnosed as SRS, cases rose from ~0% to 10% of mortalities since 2019 (SERNAPESCA data) [37](https://infosalmon.cl/adl-diagnostic-chile-entrega-conocimiento-clave-sobre-tenacibaculosis-en-la-salmonicultura/)
    - A new species, *T. salmonis*, was isolated from a 2018 Atlantic salmon gill outbreak [36](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.006963)

- **Geographical Spread:**
    - Span the Chilean Patagonia, from Los Lagos Region in the north to Aysén and Magallanes Regions in the south—covering nearly 1,200 km of marine salmon farms. affecting both wild and farmed salmon populations  [36](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijsem.0.006963) 

- **Economic Impact:**
    - Industry losses are US$700 million annually for bacterial diseases overall, of which Tenacibaculosis is a part of that [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12729926/) 
    - Tenacibaculosis has led to significant economic losses in the Chilean aquaculture industry, highlighting the need for effective management and prevention strategies.

- **Treatment & Management:**
    - Heavy use of antibiotics (compared to other global companies), primarily florfenicol and oxytetracycline, which raise serious concerns about antimicrobial resistance (AMR)  [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12729926/). 
    - Push for vaccines, probiotics, and regulatory reforms like density limits  [38](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12729926/) 
    - In response to outbreaks, Chile has implemented improved regulatory oversight and industry-wide restructuring to manage Tenacibaculosis:
	    - **Enhanced Diagnostics & Surveillance**: SERNAPESCA and ADL Diagnostic intensified monitoring since 2019 across Patagonia farms and to distinguish *T. dicentrarchi* from salmon rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) [37](https://infosalmon.cl/adl-diagnostic-chile-entrega-conocimiento-clave-sobre-tenacibaculosis-en-la-salmonicultura/)
	    - **Density & Site Regulations**: Reduced max biomass from 8 kg/m³ to 4 kg/m³ in some areas; fallowing periods extended to 45 months; 2025 decrees eliminated overlapping aquaculture zones in national parks (Atacama, Aysén) 
	    - Programs to reduce antibiotic use: [Pincoy project](https://proyectopincoy.com/en/) for example, is aimed to reduce the antibiotic use in Chile salmon aquaculture
#### Norway

- **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in Norway:**
    - Tenacibaculosis has been present in Norway since the late 1980s and leads to regular ulcerative outbreaks and high mortalities in farmed salmonids [14](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/19440)[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8553039/).
    - Significant outbreaks have been reported, with _Tenacibaculum finnmarkense_ being the most commonly isolated bacterium during these events, *T. dicentrarchi*** noted in some post-smolt events [14](https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/1956/19440). 
    - A study from 2017-2020 confirmed the high diversity of _Tenacibaculum_ strains (66) in Norway, with 95% of the strains isolated being previously unidentified [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8553039/).
    - Norwegian *T. maritimum* isolates cause crater disease (“donut” syndrome) in smolts and can be directly transmitted (horizontally) to salmon [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)

- **Geographical Spread:**
    - _Tenacibaculum_ spp. have been detected along the entire Norwegian coast, from Akershus in the southeast to Finnmark in the north [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8553039/). The north is most affected by Tenacibaculosis outbreaks [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8553039/).
    - Several strains, such as _Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi_, are present within restricted areas, while others are found across different localities and hosts [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)

- **Economic Impact:**
    - Tenacibaculosis in 2020 was considered the fifth most important cause of mortality in on-growing salmon in Norway [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon).
    - The disease causes major economic losses due to increased mortality, reduced quality at harvest, and the need for antibiotic treatments [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon).

- **Treatment & Management:**
    - Recent efforts include the development of vaccines against _Tenacibaculum_ bacteria [29](https://www.cermaq.com/news/benchmark-animal-health-and-cermaq-receive-funding-from-the-research-council-of-norway-for-the-development-of-tenacibaculum-vaccines-for-salmon).
    - Keeping smolt for 4 weeks in 26 per mille seawater can significantly reduce the effect of susceptibility to tenacibaculosis after transfer to the sea and they can better respond to an infection  [17](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)

#### New Zealand

-  **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in New Zealand
	- On Chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) farms, mainly in the Marlborough Sounds since the late 1980s, with increased relevance during summer mortality events from 2012 onward [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct), [22] 
	
- **Geographical Spread:**
	- **Marlborough Sounds** main hotspot, with problems of co-infection with New Zealand Rickettsia-like Organism (NZ-RLO) and _T. maritimum_ in Chinook salmon [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct)
	- **Akaroa Harbour** (Canterbury/South Island): Sporadic detections of NZ-RLO3 (lower pathogenicity), confirmed in targeted surveillance (2015–2017) [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct)
	- **Stewart Island** (Southland): No detections in surveillance sampling of farmed or wild salmon [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct)
	
- **Economic Impact:**
	- As a "priority disease" for NZ King Salmon (the dominant producer), it prompted industry vaccination programs (2022 onward) and MPI biosecurity responses (Controlled Area Notices until 2023), indicating significant operational costs for containment, surveillance, and lost production [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct)
	
- **Treatment & Management:**
	- MPI Controlled Area Notices (until 2023) restricted stock movements between Marlborough Sounds zones (e.g., Pelorus/Queen Charlotte Sounds) and other sites like Akaroa; emphasis on water quality and temperature control (>17°C exacerbates outbreaks) [39](https://www.mpi.govt.nz/dmsdocument/64254/direct)
	
#### Europe
-  **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in Europe
	- In Spain, France, Italy, and Greece, *T. maritimum* and *T. dicentrarchi* cause outbreaks in nursery and pre-grower stages, with mortalities exceeding 30% in affected cages or RAS units  [8](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/)
	
- **Geographical Spread:**
	- Primarily affects sea bass, sea bream, and flatfish (turbot, sole) in Mediterranean countries like Spain, Greece, Italy, France, and Turkey and peaks in warmer months [8](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/)
	
- **Economic Impact:**
	- Considered one of the most important diseases in European Sea bass, in some marine areas or in recirculation systems, they severely threaten production with mortalities rising over 30%. [40](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/01/09/deliverable-d1-2/)
	
- **Treatment & Management:**
	- Antibiotics in medicated feed or as bath treatments, which raises concerns on resistance [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
	- Treatment is difficult, and results of how the bacterium responds to a drug can vary alot from lab to field resulting in the disease having a higher overall impact [41](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/140640404/801957.Zrncic_workshop_report.pdf)


#### Scotland
-  **Tenacibaculosis Incidence in Scotland

## Conclusion

Tenacibaculosis remains a significant and increasing threat to finfish aquaculture worldwide (with some region variation), with a diversity of species and strains affecting a diversity of fish. Effective treatment options are difficult to develop, though there is increased research and focus on better support for the fish earlier in life in addition to treatments that are not antibiotics. Some vaccines show promise, but it is still too early to say. 
By implementing robust biosecurity protocols, investing in ongoing research, and fostering industry-wide cooperation, some the impact of Tenacibaculosis can be mitigated and ensure the sustainability of aquaculture operations. This comprehensive guide aims to provide the necessary information and resources to help manage Tenacibaculosis and support the health and welfare of farmed fish.
