## Overview

### What is Tenacibaculosis?
Tenacibaculosis is a bacterial ulcerative disease caused by multiple species within the genus _Tenacibaculum_, affecting numerous fish species in aquaculture [Habib, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4136090/). It is characterised by ulcerative and/or necrotic skin lesions, an eroded/hemorrhagic mouth, frayed fins, and tail rot; often leading to high mortality and significant economic losses [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). The disease was first identified in Japan in the 1970s and has since been reported in many marine wild and farmed fish in Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia [Mabrok, 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/). Despite extensive research, there is still no complete treatment   [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose), [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)[Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full)

## Symptoms of Tenacibaculosis

### Common Symptoms

- **Physical Signs:**
    - **Skin Ulcers:** Deep, necrotic ulcers on the skin often surrounded by a darkened area or zone of yellow. Ulcers often found around the mouth, fins, and body (for pictures see [Sandoval](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2369) )
    - **Fin Erosion:** Fraying and degradation of the fins, especially the caudal (tail) fin.
    - **Hemorrhages:** Reddened areas on the skin and fins due to bleeding.
    - **Gill lesions:** erosion and necrosis with little inflammation, filamentous bacteria mats also found covering the gills and necrotic tissue [Ferguson](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)
    - **Systemic infections** can result in some cases, depending on the isolate involved [Ferguson](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)
    - In cases of *Tenacibaculum maritimum* yellow mats form on the inside of the mouth especially in Atlantic salmon [Frisch, 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6211739/) in some cases teeth can fall out  [Ferguson](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)

- **Behavioral Changes:**
    - **Lethargy:** Reduced activity and slow swimming.
    - **Loss of Appetite:** Decreased feeding behavior and significant weight loss [Le Breton, 2019](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/) 
    - **Abnormal Swimming Patterns:** Fish may swim erratically or show signs of distress due to pain from ulcers.


**Progression of Symptoms**

- **Early Stages:** Small, localized lesions and mild redness around the mouth and fins.
- **Advanced Stages:** Severe skin ulcers, extensive fin erosion, and high mortality if left untreated.
- **Impact on Fish Health:** Tenacibaculosis severely compromises the skin barrier, leading to stress, reduced growth rates, and higher susceptibility to secondary infections [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf).

### Causes of Tenacibaculosis

**Etiology**
The genus Tenacibaculum currently contains a total of 39 valid fish-pathogenic and environmental species [taxa](https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/tenacibaculum). *Tenacibaculum* spp are generally considered opportunistic pathogens, i.e don't normally cause disease, but can cause infection when the opportunity arises [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). Pathogenic species include: *T. maritimum, Tenacibaculum soleae, Tenacibaculum discolor, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi* and *Tenacibaculum finnmarkense*, *Tenacibaculum* _ovolyticum_ [Fernandez, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291367/). It was previously named flexibacteriosis. 


- **Causative Agents:** 
	- *T. maritimum_* is one of the better researched species in the genus. It is also known as "yellow mouth disease" (in British Columbia, Canada and Washington State), “gliding bacterial diseases of sea fish”, "marine flexibacteriosis", “eroded mouth syndrome” and “black patch necrosis”. Originally described in 1970s with mortalities among farmed red (_Pagrus major_) and blackhead (_Acanthopagrus schlegelii_) seabream in Japan [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). It has strong adhesion to fish skin and mucus, needs seawater (≥10%), optimal growth 25-30°C, gram negative  and is thin and rod-shaped [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- *T.*soleae* identified from Senegalese sole (_Solea senegalensis_) and turbot _Scophthalmus maximus_. Mainly sole specific and causes similar ulcers as other Tenacibaculum species  [Pineiro, 2008](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.65397-0)
	- *T. discolor* identified from European and Asian sea bass (_Dicentrarchus labrax_ and _Lates calcarifer_) [Pineiro, 2008](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/ijs.0.65397-0). Less pathogenic/emerging compared to the main species and mainly environmental or opportunistic [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- *T. dicentrarchi* identified from Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) [Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/) and European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) [Pineiro, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21460137/). Found to be more aggressive in salmon challenge models. 
	- *T. finnmarkense* identified from  rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_) and Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) [Småge, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26662517/) [Nowlan, 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/11/1439). Is it quite virulent (causes more damage to host, disease at lower doses or spreads/grows faster), but higher doses of the virus are needed to infect at 8 °C than at 4 °C  [FHF, 2020](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/). Spilt into 2 genetic sub-groups (called genomovars, gv): *gv. finnmarkense and gv. ulcerans* [FHF, 2021](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901434/)
	- *T. ovolyticum* identified in Atlantic halibut (_Hippoglossus hippoglossus_) and farmed Atlantic Salmon (_Salmo salar_) [Hansen et al., 1992](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1503974/); [Avendaño-Herrera et al., 2022a](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35652633/). Grows in cold seawater and associated with deep/cold water environments [Teramoto, 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4929521/). Mainly an egg pathogen historically, but emerging as a cause of tenacibaculosis in farmed fish [Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).

- **Transmission Methods:**


    - **Direct Contact:** 
	    - *T. maritimum*, _T. dicentrarchi_ can be horizontally transferred between fish [FHF, 2020](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/), [Nowlan, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 

    - **Waterborne:**
	    -  _T. finnmarkense_: Different strains vary in their ability to cause disease, and the bacterium is not readily transmitted between fish [Småge, 2018]

| New Zealand _Tenacibaculum_ spp. (includes _T. maritimum_ types and _T. dicentrarchi_) | Only caused disease in experiments when fish were exposed by immersion, showing that spread happens mainly through water onto skin and gills.                                                 | [Kumanan, 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.06.583827v1)​ |
**Risk Factors**
Disease from _T. maritimum_ peaks in a 15–26°C range but varies by location/fish species; stress  and bad conditions which make outbreaks worse [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/).
- **Environmental Factors:** Salinity, water temperature, seasonality, algal or jellyfish blooms can affect susceptibility to Tenacibaculosis [Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full), [Småge, 2018],  [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/). 
	- Some regions: more cases with warming waters (Tasmania); others: winter outbreaks (15–20°C ideal in Spain). [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/)
	- For _T. finnmarkense_ colder water temperatures >8°C increase the risk

- **Farm Management Practices:** Generally high rearing density, excessive feed administration (especially in the case of *T.maritimum* which focuses in the mouth [Ferguson](https://fishhistopathology.com/?p=2550)) , fresh to saltwater transfer of smolts (salmonids) and/or mechanical damage of the skin and mucus barrier, healthy fish carrying the disease [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/), [Van Gelderen, 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21387991/), [Wassmuth, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aquaculture/articles/10.3389/faquc.2024.1496943/full),  [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/), Some specific risks for other species:
	- For _T. finnmarkense_ transferring salmonid smolt from high salinity environments to low sea temps in the sea increases tenacibaculosis infection [FHF, 2020](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/).
	- For *T. dicentrarchi* skin or gill damage increase disease susceptabilty, potentially warmer temperatures [Nowlan, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 
	- For *T. ovolyticum* risks include bad hygiene or presence of disease on eggs, cold deep sea water, possible equipment contamination [Nowlan, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7763822/). 
	- For *T. soleae* risks include being in Sole/brill aquaculture (Spain), tank systems, high mortality in juveniles


### Diagnosis

**Diagnostic Methods**
Diagnostic methods for Tenacibaculum infections primarily involve culture isolation, microscopy, molecular techniques like PCR and MLSA, and proteomics such as MALDI-TOF MS [Nowlan, 2020]

- **Clinical Examination:** Observation of physical symptoms, such as skin ulcers and fin erosion.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
    - **Bacterial Culture:** Isolation and identification of *Tenacibaculum spp* from tissue samples on selective agar plates with MALDI-TOF MS or biochemical tests identify species [Nowlan, 2020]
    - **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Detects bacterial DNA in tissue samples. PCR assays have been developed for _T. dicentrarchi_, _T. maritimum_ and _T. soleae_ [Wilson, 2019](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/dao/v136/dao03407) Norway favors MLSA for strain diversity; qPCR is routine in EU labs for surveillance [Le Breton, 2020](https://ressources.ciheam.org/ressources/om/pdf/b75/00007944.pdf), [Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/) 
    - **Histopathology:** Microscopic examination of tissue samples to assess the extent of tissue damage and infection, but not for species ID [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)


**Differential Diagnosis**

- **Distinguishing Tenacibaculosis from Other Diseases:** *Tenacibaculum* spp can often be in the wounds with other bacterium such as [[Moritella Viscosa]] [NIV2] and Aliivibrio, but they lack the thin gliding rods of *Tenacibaculum* spp [Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).
- Infections are often with multiple strains or even Tenacibaculum species, which also results in poor treatment efficacy  [Le Breton, 2019](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/) [Lagadec, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8553039/).

### Treatment and Prevention

**Treatment Options**
A summary table for each species is found below.
- **Current Treatments:**
    - **Antibiotics:** Most common measure to control *T.maritimum* with varying degrees of success [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) Administered through medicated feed or water to treat bacterial infections. The bacteria are naturally resistant to quinolones (a type of antibiotics commonly used against gram-negative bacteria), so efficacy is limited  [NIV](https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/tenacibaculose)


- **Supportive Care:**
    - **Improving Water Quality:** Ensuring optimal water conditions to support healing and reduce stress. 
    - **Reducing Stocking Densities:** Reduce stocking density to keep stress levels down (low stress = good immunity) and minimise skin damage [Carrilho, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427474/)
    - **Nutritional support:** Use high quality diets and functional ingredients (e.g., immunostimulants, certain algae, probiotics or prebiotics) that may enhance skin and gut barriers and reduce lesion severity [Carrilho, 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12427474/)

**Preventive Measures**

- **Biosecurity Protocols:**
    - Regular monitoring of fish health to detect and address (ether by antibiotics or culling) early signs of infection [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
    - Different strains of _T. maritimum_ are locally sourced and not internationally, which helps with genetic tracking of outbreaks  [Habib, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4136090/).

    
- **Vaccines**:
	- No commercial vaccine, except for one for turbot in Spain, which needs boosters [Romalde, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15962472/) . The broad genetic variety means broad vaccines fail [Mabrok, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9853564/#s10) 
	- Tested vaccines include: barramundi in Singapore, salmon in Tasmania, salmon in Chile [Le Breton, 2019](http://www.medaid-h2020.eu/index.php/2019/02/05/tenacibaculosis/) and immunization with recombinant proteins against _T. finnmarkense_ [FHF, 2024](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901655/)


- **Farm Management Practices:**
    - Using equipment and facilities designed to minimize skin abrasions and injuries.
    - Ensuring adequate nutrition to support immune function and wound healing.
    - Implementing fallowing periods and site rotations to break the infection cycle [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853564/)[2](https://www.int-res.com/articles/dao2006/71/d071p255.pdf)
    -  Salmonids that have been exposed to low-strength salinity appear to have a better ability to respond to an infection. [FHF, 2020](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901433/)
    - Salmonid transfer to sea above  5˚C significantly lowers _T. finnmarkense_ infection rates [FHF, 2021](https://www.fhf.no/prosjekter/prosjektbasen/901434/)
