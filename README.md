# Manolin Fish Disease Library

This repository contains the source information for the [Fish Disease Library](https://fishdiseases.manolinaqua.com/), and the corresponding documentation to contribute information back into the library for future readers.

## Why the initiative started

During the development of [Manolin's](https://manolinaqua.com) analytical engine we accumulated a large collection of fish health information. This information took alot of time to consolidate as we had to crawl the depths of the internet to find much of what we were looking for. Internally we started referencing this sort of "library" frequently and ultimately came to the conclusion that this data can not only benefit us, but also the aquaculture community as a whole. So we decided to open source it and allow for folks to contribute their own unique knowledge for the greater good of aquaculture.
