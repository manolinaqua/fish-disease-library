# Manolin Fish Disease Library

This repository contains the source information for the [Fish Disease Library](https://fishdiseases.manolinaqua.com/), and the corresponding documentation to contribute information back into the library for future readers.

# Testing Updates

## Contribute

To contribute to the Manolin Fish Disease Library:

1. Fork the [fish-disease-library](https://github.com/manolinaqua/fish-disease-library) repository.
2. Clone your version of the repository into local machine. [Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
4. The structure of the entire library is built using the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Please go and download the appropriate version for your machine.
    1. We recommend using your computer for this and not the mobile version of the application.
    2. While you can edit the markdown files specifically using any platform, there are a number of features unique to Obsidian like tags, links and search that we are currently utilizing in the final application.
5. In the Obsidian vault switcher, select **Open folder as vault**. Don't open the root folder as a vault, as this may lead to links being updated incorrectly.
6. After you've made your edits, follow Git's pull request process to submit a change back to the main repository. [Example](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Fix typos and mistakes**: If you want to fix a typo or other small modifications, you can submit a pull request. For smaller edits, you can use the GitHub web interface instead of cloning the repository.
- **Add missing or outdated content**: If you want to contribute missing or outdated content, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/manolinaqua/fish-disease-library/issues) before you start working on it. We'll use that area to discuss assignments and coordination of tasks.

### Disease framework

For each disease, we follow a standard framework of information to keep the information consistent across the platform. At a highlevel, these are the categories that we have for each disease:

1. Overview
2. Symptoms
    1. Causes
    2. Diagnosis
    3. Treatments and Prevention
    4. Cases Studies
4. Data Insights
5. Latest Research and References

Other than that, we follow the general style guide reccommended by Obsidian's [Style guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Contributing+to+Obsidian/Style+guide).
