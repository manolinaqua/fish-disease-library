# Manolin Fish Disease Library

This repository contains the source information for the [Fish Disease Library](https://fishdiseases.manolinaqua.com/), and the corresponding documentation to contribute information back into the library for future readers.

## Why the initiative started

During the development of [Manolin's](https://manolinaqua.com) analytical engine we accumulated a large collection of fish health information. This information took alot of time to consolidate as we had to crawl the depths of the internet to find much of what we were looking for. Internally we started referencing this sort of "library" frequently and ultimately came to the conclusion that this data can not only benefit us, but also the aquaculture community as a whole. So we decided to open source it and allow for folks to contribute their own unique knowledge for the greater good of aquaculture.

## What can be Contributed?

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Fix typos and mistakes**: If you want to fix a typo or other small modifications, you can submit a pull request. For smaller edits, you can use the GitHub web interface instead of cloning the repository.
- **Add missing or outdated content**: If you want to contribute missing or outdated content, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/manolinaqua/fish-disease-library/issues) before you start working on it. We'll use that area to discuss assignments and coordination of tasks.

## Format of the Library

For each disease, we follow a standard framework of information to keep things consistent across the platform. At a highlevel, these are the categories that we have for each disease:

1. Overview
2. Symptoms
    1. Causes
    2. Diagnosis
    3. Treatments and Prevention
    4. Cases Studies
3. Data Insights
4. Latest Research and References

When creating citiations we use **[APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/reference-examples.pdf) style**, ensure that any new citations follow this format.

Other than that, we follow the general style guide recommended by Obsidian's [Style guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Contributing+to+Obsidian/Style+guide).

Feel free to look at an existing disease page to get a sense of how things should be formatted.
